            <p> While public trust in public servants and business operators globally is running low there is a real need to ensure that investments in Cameroon are protected. According to Doing Business in Cameroon published by the Foreign and Commonwealths Office Cameroonâ€™s economic growth is expected to accelerate over the next five years period from an official estimated of 4.1 percent GDP in 2011 to an average of 4.5 percent in 2016 going forward. One of the incentives to pushing our economic and social develop growth rate even further is to ensure the availability of skilled professionals capable of providing support for the improvement of our governance and macro economic situation. To this end the Lord Mayor of Buea Municipality is offering a number of full scholarships for fellows to participate in the Business Management and Public Service Integrity Fellowship that is jointly organized by the International Governance Institute of the UK and Buea Municipal Council in Buea, Cameroon. To benefit from this scholarship ( alongside your application) you must write a short essay of not more than 200 words each explaining your understanding of the following national development policy documents:</p>
            <p>The National Anti Corruption Strategy of Cameroon (200 words)</p>
            <p> The National Governance Program of Cameroon (200 words)</p>
            <p>Cameroon Development Goals by 2035 (200 words)</p>
            <p>Again in your essay you will need to describe briefly what these policies seek to achieve and how you would contribute as an individual to the realization of each. Preferably in this section we strongly suggest you prepare an additional proposal of a project you will like to embark on after the fellowship in no more than 200 words spelling out its purpose, objectives, indicators of success as well as your projects impact on the growth and employment of the population of Buea Municipality. The total number of expected word limit on your BMF scholarship application form is 800 words. With BMF we desire to provide greater support to the growth and development of your potentials. Interested in BMF apply here to be considered for a scholarship.</p>
