            <p>The Buea Municipal Council Fellowships (BMF) are awarded to deeply committed individuals willing to conduct actions that demonstrate compliance with ethics and best practices in the management of their businesses and service to the Cameroonian public. Before the fellowship you will need to provide a summary of your current work as linked to community service. After the fellowship you will need to provide a brief report on how the fellowship has and continue to impact your work and management practice including links/ pictures in support of these details. Please note that due to an absence of a volunteer translator in the French language, the BMFâ€™s working language is currently English. Applications must be filled and submitted in English.</p>
